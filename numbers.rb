# Ruby has integers and floats

# Ruby follows the PEMDAS rule for integers and floats

# Contains the same behavior as Python for Mathematical operations

# Ruby has multiple methods on objets

#To get the class of an object object you have to use the methods class

puts 100.class

#The method above prints the class on the object

puts 100.next
