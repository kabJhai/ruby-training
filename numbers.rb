#Numbers

# Ruby has integers and floats

# Ruby follows the PEMDAS rule for integers and floats

# Contains the same behavior as Python for Mathematical operations

# Ruby has multiple methods on objets

#To get the class of an object object you have to use the methods class

puts 100.class
puts 100.0.class

#The method above prints the class on the object

puts 100.next

#Float follows the same rule as in Python

#Except

#To convert to an int

puts 100.0.to_i

#To convert to a float

puts 100.to_f

#To convert to a string

puts 100.to_s

#If either the operand or the operator;  or the numerator or the denominator are float the result will be a float

puts 10 / 4

puts 10.0 / 4

# Other methods like ceil, floor, round, etc can also be called

puts 12.4.ceil

puts 112.4.floor

puts 12.4.round
